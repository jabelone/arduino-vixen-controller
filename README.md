# arduino-vixen-controller
Use your arduino to allow vixen 3 to control a bunch of relays or FETS!
Use as many channels as GPIO pins

This small piece of software allows you to make one of those cool musical 
christmas light display with some very cheap, basic hardware. Just load 
it onto an arduino and connect up the output GPIOs to some relays or FETs
to create a cool display.  It uses a computer program called Vixen.  I
forget how it's setup exactly but in Vixen you need to use a serial output 
device or something like that.
